* Lab contains
+ Vulnerable to username enumeration using it's response time
+ Test credential
  + username = ~wiener~
  + password = ~peter~
* End goal
+ Enumerate for valid username
+ Enumerate for valid password
+ Login with those credential and access their account

* DONE Enumeration of username

+ Login with invalid credential and send that request to burp repeater
+ Send multiple request with multiple value from repeater and observe
+ See that ip is being block due to many invalid attempts
+ [[./assets/screenshots/lab5-ip-blocked.png]]
+ Have to spoof the ip with ~X-Forwarded-For~
+ Now send this request to intruder and select attack type to ~Pitchfork~  to add payload on ~X-Forwarded-For~ value and username.
+ Add payload for ~X-Forwarded-For~ numbers value and for ~username~ add payload from given username wordlist

+ After finish the attack select ~Response received~ and ~Response completed~ from ~Column~ tab to measure response time of each payload
+ Notice that one of the response times was significantly longer than the others. Repeat this request a few times to make sure it consistently takes longer, then make a note of this username
+ After running few times one perticular payload is taking longer time than other and that is ~albuquerque~

+ Now send a request with username ~albuquerque~ and send it to intruder to brute-force the password

#+end_src
+ After finishing attack look for status code ~302~
+ Here is one payload that gives ~302~ it is our password for username ~albuquerque~

* Solve the lab
We enumrate both username and password
- username : ~albuquerque~
- password : ~master~
