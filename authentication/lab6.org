* Lab Contains
- Vulnerable to logic flaw in its ~password~ brute-force protection.
** Test Credential
- username = wiener
- password = peter
** Victim's username
- username = carlos
* End Goal
- Brute-Force the account with given candidate password list
- Access carlos account

* Access lab
- Access lab and observe the login functionality.
- Login with given test account and observe the application

* Attack victim account
- It let me try to attempt to login 3 times. If 3 attempt fails it block the IP
- Message: ~You have made too many incorrect login attempts. Please try again in 1 minute(s).~
- But it reset the counter if i login with given test account
** Now What to do?
- We can bypass this IP blocking by modifiying the payload.
- Add username payload like 1 time wiener and 1 time peter
 | wiener |
 | peter  |
 | wiener |
 | peter  |
- Modify given password with 1 time with correct password of wiener  which is peter
 | peter    |
 | 123456   |
 | peter    |
 | password |
 Like this
- Add maximum concurrent request to 1 in burp intruder Resource pool tab to slow down the request
- After finishing attack filter out the result by ~302~ http response

* Result
- Found the password for victim user ~carlos~
- password = ~trustno1~
/this can be different on every new instance of the lab/
* Solve the lab
Enter victim account with credential and solve the lab
- username = carlos
- password = trustno1
