+ Logic flaw in item purchasing workflow
** Test account
       - username: =wiener=
       - password: =peter=
* End Goal
+ Exploit the flaw and buy "Lightweight l33t leather jacket"
* Exploit
- Access the lab
- Login to account with credentials
- Add targeted product to cart & send this request to repeater
- Try to add 100 quantity of this product see that reponse, it gives an error =400 bad request: "Invalid parameter: quantity"=
- So, we can not add more that 99 quantity of same product in cart
- Now send this request to intruder
** Request on intruder

#+end_src
Start attack with =Null payloads= and from payload settings select =Continue indefinitely=
- Go to cart page and refresh time to time to see the changes
- See that price increasing with large quantity. But price suddenly switches to large negative number start counting up towards 0
- Stop the attack
  
** Next Step
- Clear the cart
- Now create same intruder attack but generate exactly payload =323= and select Maximum concurrent request to 1
- When attack finishes, go to =POST/cart= from repeater and send a single request for =47= jackets. Total price should be now =-$1221.96=
- Now add another suitable prodcut to cart so that the total falls between 0 to 100
- Place order to solve the lab
