** Test account
- username: =wiener=

- Bypass lab's authentcation, access the admin interface and delete user =carlos=
* Exploit
- access the lab
- login with [[#test-account][test account's]] credential
- in account page there is a feature to change user role
- change to a role and observer the request on burp
  - this send a =POST= request to =/role-selector=
  - send this request to repeater and change role to =admin= and send this
    - it give =No login credentials provided= this error
- log out the and turn on intercept on burp to see if we can change the role on login through intercept
- Forward =POST/login= request and drop the next request =GET /role-selector=. Go to browser and go to home page see that you have now =admin= access. Beacause of drop the request it defaulted role to =administrator=
- Go to =admin= panel and delete =carlos= to solve the lab
