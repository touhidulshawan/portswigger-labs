* Exploit
- Access the lab
- Go Register page
- Click on Email Client (on top of page) to get your email to register an account
- Notes this text =If you work for DontWannaCry, please use your @dontwannacry.com email address=
- Now fill-up the registration form to create an account
- Active the created account. After verfication login into your account
- Go to =/admin= page to see if we can access =admin= privilege. No luck it shows that =Admin interface only available if logged in as a DontWannaCry user=
- So somehow we have update our email address to =@dontwannacry.com= domain
** Examine the email client 
- Notice that it showing =Displaying all emails @exploit-0a52000d033b0ad6878101c001270004.exploit-server.net and all subdomains=
- Now go to registration page and create an account with very long (200) character email address
  - Like =veryverylong@=@exploit-0a52000d033b0ad6878101c001270004.exploit-server.net=
- Verify and login into account see that on account page long email address has truncated to 255 character
** Exploit 
- Go to registration page and create an account but this time include =@dontwannacry.com=
  - =veryverylong@dontwannacry.com.exploit-0a52000d033b0ad6878101c001270004.exploit-server.net=
  - choose charecter wisely so that it truncate all character after 'm'
- After verify and login see that you have access to admin panel
- Delete user =carlos= from admin panel to solve the lab
