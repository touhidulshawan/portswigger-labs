* Lab Contains
- path traversal vulnerability on ~display of product images~
* End Goal
- retrieve the contents of ~/etc/passwd~ file
* Solution
- Access the lab and observe
- open the product image on new tab and capture on burpsuite
  - url looks like this ~https://0a8200a2030143cb8e636fc700dc0020.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=64.jpg~
  - Here we can see that it is accepting file name through ~filename~ parameter
  #+begin_src shell
    GET /image?filename=64.jpg HTTP/2
    Host: 0a8200a2030143cb8e636fc700dc0020.web-security-academy.net

  #+end_src
- Now change the file name ~64.png~ to ~/etc/passwd~ and send the request
  - ~400 Bad request~: File not found
  - Now try with directory traversal sequences like ~../../../etc/passwd~
  - Awla! ~200 OK~ found the file. It is showing the the content of /etc/passwd file

So the correct payload to solve this lab is *../../../etc/passwd*
