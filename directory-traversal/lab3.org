* Lab Contains
- vulnerability on display of product images
- strips path traversal sequences before using it
* End Goal
- retrieve the contents of /etc/passwd file
* Solution
- Access the lab
- Open any of product image in new tab and intercept the request in burpsuite
- Change filename value to ~../../../etc/passwd~
  - ~400 Bad request~ because it is  striping our traversal sequences
- Now try with absolute path ~/etc/passwd~
  - Still now ~400 Bad request~
- If it strip sequences '../', we can double the sequences like this
  1. ~....//....//....//etc/passwd~ then it will become after strip ~../../../etc/passwd~
  2. Awala!! ~200 OK~  response. retrieved the contents of /etc/passwd file
* Payload to Solve lab
~....//....//....//etc/passwd~
