* Lab contain
- controls access to certain admin functionality based on the Referer header
- Admin credentials
  - username: =administrator=
  - password: =admin=
*** Test account
       - username: =wiener=
       - password: =peter=
* End Goal
- Promote =wiener= to administrator
* Exploit
- access the lab
- login with =administrator= credentials
- promote =carlos= and sent HTTP request to burp repeater
- login with =wiener= in private browser
- go =/admin-roles?username=carlos&action=upgrade=
- request is treated as *unauthorized* due to absent Referer header
- copy =wiener= session cookie into the existing burp repeater request, change username to =wiener= and sent it
- Haa! Lab solved
